TODO:
-Requires elements in pickups and platform to load a file
-Textures are saved as Files and not absolute texture paths for pickups and platforms (use the background image as a template for this)
-Should get a pop-up if import or export fails

GOALS:
-Get a working overall map editor working
-Work this into the game package
-Add more room for other pickups besides just AudioLogs
