FOR PEOPLE NEW TO UPGRADE:
-The Map package is almost done
-The Game package is where it is at! However, if you are anxious about adding your code, feel free to just make some maps. We're going to need a lot of content.
-The project is broken up into a couple areas on the programming side
	>Data storage and loading (see Chris)
	>Physics (see Alex)
	>In game UI (tbd)
	>Menuscreen UI (tbd)
	>Gameplay/Interactions (tbd)

TODO:
-Requires elements in pickups and platform to load a file
-Textures are saved as Files and not absolute texture paths for pickups and platforms (use the background image as a template for this)
-Should get a pop-up if import or export fails

GOALS:
-Get a working overall map editor working
-Work this into the game package
-Add more room for other pickups besides just AudioLogs... may need to discuss all forms of pick ups in the club meeting
